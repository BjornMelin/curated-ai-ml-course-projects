## 🌟 Overview

This repository contains my work and implementations from the Machine Learning Specialization course. It serves as both a learning journey documentation and a resource for others studying machine learning concepts.

## 📘 Course Structure

The Machine Learning Specialization consists of three main courses:

1. **Supervised Machine Learning**
   - Regression and Classification
   - Gradient Descent
   - Feature Engineering
2. **[Advanced Learning Algorithms](./advanced-learning-algorithms)**
   - [Neural Networks](./advanced-learning-algorithms/neural-networks)
   - Decision Trees
   - Tree Ensembles
3. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Clustering
   - Dimensionality Reduction
   - Anomaly Detection
