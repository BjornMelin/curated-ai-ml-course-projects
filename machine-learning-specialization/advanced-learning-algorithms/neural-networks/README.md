## üåü Overview

This section is part of the Machine Learning Specialization's Advanced Learning Algorithms course. Here, we dive deep into neural network architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Through a combination of theoretical understanding and practical implementations, you'll learn how to:

- Design and implement neural networks from scratch
- Understand activation functions and their impact
- Master forward and backward propagation
- Optimize neural network performance
- Apply neural networks to real-world problems

- üìä `data/`: Dataset files used in notebooks and assignments

## üöÄ Prerequisites

Before starting with the neural networks section, ensure you have the following installed:

```bash
# Required Software
Python 3.8+
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

# Key Libraries
numpy>=1.21.0
tensorflow>=2.8.0
matplotlib>=3.4.0
pandas>=1.3.0
scikit-learn>=0.24.0
```

## üéØ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/curated-ai-ml-course-projects.git
cd curated-ai-ml-course-projects/machine-learning-specialization/advanced-learning-algorithms/neural-networks
```

2. Set up a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## üí° Usage

The content is organized sequentially, recommended to be followed in order:

1. Start with the introductory notebooks in `notebooks/` to understand core concepts
2. Complete the weekly assignments in `assignments/` to reinforce learning
3. Experiment with the provided datasets in `data/` for hands-on practice

Example notebook usage:

```python
# Import common libraries
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load helper functions
from utils import plot_decision_boundary

# Create a simple neural network
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=25, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```
